# benchstat.sh — run benchmarks, compare against a baseline, and emit trend artifacts.
# Usage:
#   bash bin/scripts/benchstat.sh              # run benchmarks, save to bench/current.txt
#   bash bin/scripts/benchstat.sh --compare    # compare bench/current.txt against bench/baseline.txt
#   bash bin/scripts/benchstat.sh --smoke      # run one iteration for CI smoke
#   bash bin/scripts/benchstat.sh --trend      # write bench/summary.md from the current run
#   bash bin/scripts/benchstat.sh --matrix     # print the authoritative benchmark matrix
